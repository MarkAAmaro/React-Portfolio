# Mark Amaro's Web Development Portfolio

## Introduction

Being an upcoming web developer is a new begining for me. To allow myself to share projects is essential, not just for job applications or freelance work, but also for collaborative opportunities with fellow developers. This portfolio is created using React to demonstrate proficiency in the latest web development technologies.


## About Me

I am a college graduate from Texas A&M San Antonio with a bachelor's degree in Accounting. With 9 years of experience as a business analyst, I have conducted investigative research to improve and implement various business processes. My love for computers led me to explore the realm of coding. Currently, I am enrolled in a bootcamp to further enhance my coding skills. Expect to see more projects as I continue on this journey.
